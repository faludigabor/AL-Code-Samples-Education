Update Sub-form (Sub-Page) from Main Page to apply Filters

Solution:
To solve the above Problem statement we have to make use of the Currpage.Update() function which shall update the Subpage.
As you can see in the below window a function is created Vendorfilter() on Subpage with the “vendor” parameter, in this function filter is added 
for the vendor on the part page and then CurrPage.Update() is used. This function will update the Subpage with the vendor.

Now, call this function on “OnValidate” trigger of the Main page field, here we have “Vendor” field on Main Page.

Example
CurrPage.<SubpageName>.Page.<FunctionName>(Rec.<FieldName>);

In this example we have
CurrPage.POLines.page.Vendorfilter(Rec.Vendor);
